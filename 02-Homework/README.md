PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This webpage lets the user enter any city they want and the current weather conditions are displayed on the screen as well as a 5 day forecast for that city. That city is then saved to their search history so they can click it at any time if they want to view the weather there again. When the page is loaded, the search history is still there and the page shows the weather conditions of the most previous city searched. A clear button is available in order to clear search history.
